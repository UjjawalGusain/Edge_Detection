# Edge Detection From Scratch

## Introduction
#### In this project, we will perform edge detection on a greyscale image using convolution operation.
#### Note: We have used Sobel Filters.

## Results

## Improvements to be implemented
- The program works extremely slow and inefficiently for large images. The example image used here was originally (3121 * 3710) pixels wide and so significant amount was taken for convolution operation. In small images like MNIST dataset(28*28), the result was nearly instantaneous.
